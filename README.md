# 🧬 Bare Minimum R  
**By Figure One Lab (Dan Lee)**

## Overview

**Bare Minimum R** is the first in a set of courses designed to help biologists learn essential computational skills using R. It was created specifically for those who have never (or barely) coded before and want to jump-start their journey into computational data analysis.

This course is available **for free** through the Figure One Lab website and is hosted on **Kajabi** and **Posit Cloud**.

## 🎯 Intended Audience

Anyone who has completed **at least one year of university-level biology** and wants to learn basic data analysis in R.

It doesn't matter whether you are a:
- Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD student
- Postdoc
- Academic or industry scientist

If you're a biologist looking to build confidence in R, this course is for you.

## 📖 Why I’m Doing This

Although I am already familiar with R, I have been **out of practice** for the past two years due to my responsibilities as an **Assistant Professor** and **Head of the Department of Microbiology**. My role did not require hands-on coding during this time, and I was not in an environment where computational work was necessary.

Now, as I return to more hands-on **biological data analysis and bioinformatics**, I am taking this course to **refresh my memory**, revisit key concepts, and rebuild fluency with R and the tidyverse.

This course offers a structured, practical, and concise way to rebuild those skills.

## ✍️ Preface

Getting comfortable with R shouldn't take years. It might take **months** to know R well enough for most biological data analysis, but it could take just **a few days** of consistent effort to get over the initial hurdle.

**Bare Minimum R** was created to help biologists:
- Get past the mental block of coding
- Gain confidence by producing tangible results
- Skip non-essential content to focus on what matters *right now*

> The goal is **momentum** — not perfection.

Once you catch the bug for analyzing biological data, you can always circle back to fill in knowledge gaps later — just like most professional computational biologists do.

## 📚 Course Outline

### I. R Basics
Learn about:
- R syntax
- Data types
- Data structures
- Working with data frames  
Includes interactive exercises.

### II. `dplyr`
Learn to manipulate data using the `dplyr` package:
- `select()`, `filter()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()`, `summarize()`, and more

### III. `ggplot2`
Learn to visualize data with the `ggplot2` package:
- Bar plots, scatter plots, aesthetics, layers, and themes

### IV. Subset CCLE
Real-world challenge:
> You are the only computational biologist in a team working on anti-metastatic drugs for skin cancer.  
You’ll subset CCLE RNA-seq data and annotate R code to understand what it does — simulating the kind of data wrangling often required in real research.

### V. Explore CCLE
Perform real data cleaning and visualization:
- Recommend the best skin cancer cell line for testing your team’s drug candidate  
- Use all the tools you've learned in previous modules

## 💡 Learning Approach

The course uses **self-guided and interactive notebooks** so you can learn without depending on a live instructor. Each R notebook is designed to:
- Mimic a one-on-one tutoring session
- Include explanations, examples, and exercises
- Build independence and confidence

> You’ll learn R by running real code — not just watching someone else do it.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Taking this course is a strategic reboot — not a beginner’s start. Even if you’ve used R before, going through the **Bare Minimum R** notebooks can help rebuild lost muscle memory and spark new ideas for how to structure your analysis pipeline.

> Learning isn’t linear — it’s iterative.
