# Motivating Question

Every analysis that a computational biologist undertakes should be motivated by a clearly stated biological question. Otherwise, how will you know if the data you have is appropriate and what analysis should be done?

So let's do a bit of role-playing. Imagine that we are a team of biologists working for a biotech developing drugs to treat cancer. The biotech is called Figure One Lab (What else did you think I was going to call it?). Our mission is to make drugs that interfere with skin cancer metastasis.

To see if our drugs work, we need to be able to test any anti-metastatic drugs we make on cells that model metastatic skin cancer cells. To start, we have decided to use cancer cell lines, because they are commercially available and relatively easy to grow at the bench. Given the dozens of skin cancer cell lines we can choose from, it's not clear which cell line we should use. We just know that we want to use a cell line that resembles metastatic skin cancer cells.

We start with a bit of literature review. We come across this paper: Riker, A.I., Enkemann, S.A., Fodstad, O. et al. The gene expression profiles of primary and metastatic melanoma yields a transition point of tumor progression and metastasis. *BMC Med Genomics* **1**, 13 (2008). DOI: [10.1186/1755-8794-1-13](https://doi.org/10.1186/1755-8794-1-13). Licensed under CC BY 2.0.

From the paper:

> We have utilized gene microarray analysis and a variety of molecular techniques to compare 40 metastatic melanoma (MM) samples...to 42 primary cutaneous cancers...
>
> ...the metastatic melanomas express higher levels of genes such as MAGE, GPR19, BCL2A1, MMP14, SOX5, BUB1, RGS20, and more.

The authors describe transcriptional differences between metastatic melanomas and primary melanomas. This seems promising. This motivates us to ask: **Based on the gene expression profiles of the metastatic melanomas studied by Riker et al., which skin cancer cell line should we use?**

Fortunately, we can access the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiles of 1000+ cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. We can do some simple exploration of this data to recommend a skin cancer cell line appropriate for testing our drugs.

We depend on you, the sole computational biologist on the team, to explore that data and make a speedy recommendation for which cell line we should use.

## Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia

Now we are going to apply what you have learned so far to clean and explore RNA-seq data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE).

The CCLE is a comprehensive and publicly accessible data resource that provides detailed genetic and pharmacological profiles of many human cancer cell lines. The creation of this resource began in 2008 as a collaboration between the Broad Institute and the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research. They aimed to catalogue and characterize a comprehensive collection of human cancer cell lines and to make standardized, high-quality molecular data from these cell lines available for researchers everywhere. Before the establishment of the CCLE, cancer researchers faced reproducibility challenges due to the lack of standardized cancer cell line datasets, making it difficult to compare results or draw broad conclusions about cancer biology and treatment responses. The CCLE addressed these challenges.

## RNA-Seq

Since RNA-seq data is one of the major data assets in the CCLE and the data type we will explore in this and future courses, it behooves us to define what it is.

In brief, RNA-seq is a next-generation sequencing technique used to study gene expression. It quantifies the transcriptome ‚Äî the complete set of RNA transcripts ‚Äî of a given biological sample, measuring the number of RNA transcripts corresponding to each gene. RNA-seq used in well-designed experiments can capture how the transcriptomes of biological samples change across different conditions, such as "Control" vs "Treated", or "Primary Tumor" vs "Metastasis". It is a powerful tool for understanding complex biology and is ubiquitous in every area of biology.

## Download CCLE RNA-Seq Data

First things first. Where do you even download CCLE RNA-seq data? Often in computational biology work, it's not so obvious which sites and which links allow you to download the right data files. More likely than not, you will have to download several files that seem promising, read them into R or Python, and inspect each one with your eyes in order to figure out which files are the ones you actually want.

For this section, I will spare you that trouble. I have already done that work for you. The files we need are already in `cloud/project/data`. However, I want you to still retrace the steps to get those files:

1. Go to [https://depmap.org/portal/data_page/?tab=allData](https://depmap.org/portal/data_page/?tab=allData)
2. Select a file set to view: **CCLE 2019**
3. Download **"CCLE_RNAseq_genes_counts_20180929.gct.gz"**. This records the number of each transcript measured, or counted, in each RNA-seq sample. We call this the counts matrix or the counts data.
4. Download **"Cell_lines_annotations_20181226.txt"**. This is the metadata corresponding to the counts data.
5. Move both downloaded files to `cloud/project/data`.

The downloaded data was released with this publication: Ghandi et al. Next-generation characterization of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. *Nature* **569**, 503‚Äì508 (2019). DOI: [10.1038/s41586-019-1186-3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1186-3).

I hope that you can appreciate how unclear it often is to navigate to the data we need. This is a common issue for computational biologists.

## Need for More Compute

Because many modern biological datasets, including this one, are quite large, analyzing them often requires significant computational resources.

To run the code below, I had to upgrade my Posit Cloud plan from **Cloud Free ($0/month)** to **Cloud Basic ($25/month)**.

I do not expect you to upgrade to Cloud Basic for this course. I want to keep this course free.

However, this means that you will not be able to work with the full CCLE RNA-seq dataset with just Cloud Free. As a workaround, I am going to output a subset of the full CCLE RNA-seq dataset for you to work on in `"4_ccle_explore.qmd"`. This won't change the essential skills you will still learn; it just makes the size of the dataset manageable in Cloud Free.

## Treat ChatGPT Like Your Private Tutor

I provide the code I used to output a subset of the CCLE RNA-seq dataset below. I do not expect you to run through the code blocks below because it requires compute that is not available in Cloud Free. I do, however, expect you to read through the following code blocks, look at the output under each code block, and annotate what each code block does. I have essentially turned my code into a code-annotation exercise for you to get more experience parsing code.

One of the main reasons why I created this exercise is that it reflects what computational biologists do on a daily basis. We frequently have to go through other people's code, which usually has functions that we have not seen before, and must figure it out on the spot.

While reading my code, you may run into functions we have not explicitly covered before. But because you already understand the basics of how R works, I am confident that you can reason your way through anything I throw at you. And given that ChatGPT and other tools like it are such powerful learning companions, I expect that they will be very useful to you in parsing code.

Let's get you some experience using ChatGPT to parse code. For the following questions, provide a written response with the help of ChatGPT.

### What does the `biomaRt` package do?

```R
# Your written response here
# The biomaRt package in R provides a powerful interface to query BioMart databases, particularly Ensembl, to access a wide variety of biological data. It is part of the Bioconductor project and is especially useful in genomics and bioinformatics workflows.
```

### What does `table()` do?

```R
# Your written response here
# The table() function in R is used to create frequency tables‚Äîit counts how many times each unique value (or combination of values) appears in a vector or a set of vectors.
```

### What does the following line of code do?

```R
ccle_counts <- read.csv(paste0(getwd(),"/data/CCLE_RNAseq_genes_counts_20180929.gct.gz"), header = TRUE, sep = "\t", skip = 2)
```

```R
# Your written response here

Reads a tsv (tab separated value) and saves it in ccle_counts variable.
```

## Subset CCLE RNA-seq Data

Again, I do not expect you to run through the code blocks below because it requires compute that is not available in Cloud Free. I do, however, expect you to read through the following code blocks, look at the output under each code block, and annotate what each code block does.

Treat ChatGPT like your private tutor here. The goal here is for you to learn how to use ChatGPT to decipher code you are seeing for the first time. I want you to appreciate just how powerful a learning companion ChatGPT is. By understanding the code I present here, you are equipped to write more advanced code needed in the next notebook.
